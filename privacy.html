<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>As part of the registration process for our weekly e-newsletter, we
collect personal information. We use that information for a couple of
reasons: to tell you about what we will be singing each week and send
you updates on gigs and Howl related news; to contact you if we need to
obtain or provide additional information; to check our records are
right and to check every now and then that you’re happy and satisfied.
We don't rent or trade email lists with other organisations and
businesses.<br>
<br>
We use a third party provider, MailChimp, to deliver our newsletter. We
gather statistics around email opening and clicks using industry
standard technologies to help us monitor and improve our e-newsletter.
For more information, please see <a href="https://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/">MailChimp’s privacy notice</a>.<br>
<br>
You can unsubscribe to general mailings at any time of the day or night
by clicking the unsubscribe link at the bottom of any of our emails or
by emailing us to ask to be unsubscribed.
